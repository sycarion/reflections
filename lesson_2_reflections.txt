1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a hidden folder to track the changes and marks the contents of the repository.

Files are not tracked yet because nothing has been committed.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory contains files and the repository contains changes to those files. The staging area is a bridge between the two. It allows you to set up the committs that will be tracked by the repositories.
It is very helpful to be able to work on multiple areas, but committ changes for an individual area.
