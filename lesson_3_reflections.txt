1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote is helpful when you work from more than one computer and/or with more than one person.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatic pushes and pulls encounter the same issues as automatic committs. You could have to many committs and those committs could overwrite changes you have made.
