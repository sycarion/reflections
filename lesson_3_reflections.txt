1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote is helpful when you work from more than one computer and/or with more than one person.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatic pushes and pulls encounter the same issues as automatic committs. You could have to many committs and those committs could overwrite changes you have made.

3. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can determine the changes that others have made as compared to your changes.

4. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be harder. I would have to coordinate who would change specific files at a specific time.
I wouldn't want to collaborate without some system of handling changes.
